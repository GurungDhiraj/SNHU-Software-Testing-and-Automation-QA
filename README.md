# SNHU CS320: Software Testing and Automation QA

**Course Description:**

Students will apply software engineering testing strategies and practices as part of the software development life cycle, including requirements analysis, verification and validation, and quality management. The creation of unit tests and analysis of various testing approaches will also be covered.

**Course Competencies:**

This course covers the following competencies, which represent the knowledge and skills relevant to your field:

CS-30415: Create unit tests using code to uncover errors

CS-30416: Analyze various approaches to software testing based on requirements

CS-30417: Apply appropriate testing strategies to meet requirements

**Questions:**

Q: How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

A: To ensure that my code is functional I need to conduct thorough tests and make sure my code is compiling without any issues. I should also test a variety of edge cases to make sure that the program works for each of the edge cases

Q: How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

A: I should always try to think of the user’s needs and requirements and create a program that not only fits the user’s requirements but also is simple enough for the user to use. I can try to gauge their needs and software proficiency by conversing with them and asking them a series of questions about their software needs and wants.

Q: How do I approach designing software?

A: I approach software designing by looking at the client's needs and talking to them about how they envision the program to work. The client may not necessarily know the inner workings of the program from a software perspective and what they need may differ from what they want. Talking to them will help me figure out the client’s needs and wants more clearly. This in turn will give me more information on how to better start designing the program.
